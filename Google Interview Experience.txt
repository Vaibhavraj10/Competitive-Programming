1a. Input: start word, end word, array of words
Find if its possible to reach end from start. You can only move from one word to another if both differ by exact one character. If yes, find the minimum steps to reach end.

1b. Given a graph(no of nodes, list of edges u,v) , cat position, mouse position. Device an algo to determine if the cat can catch the mouse or the mouse escapes. Cat wins if both are at the same vertex at the same time. They take alternate turns. Consider all the cases- cat moves first, mouse move first, no:of nodes>=1.
